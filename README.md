# Pig Dice


### By **Jen Bruce** and **John Sweet**

## Description
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _User 1 can click a button and receives a random number._
* _User 1 can click another button to log score and pass their turn._
* _If 1 is rolled, then User's current round score is set to zero and user passes their turn._
* _When either User's score reaches 100 or more, the game is over._

## Steps

* _Alternating turns when player hits 1 by disabling button functions_
* _Click a button to create a random number from 1-6_
* _If number is 1, set their current score to zero and change turns._
* _If not 1, add the number to the current player's score variable._
* _They can roll again._
* _If they click Pass, the score increases and turn alternates._
* _When either score equals 100, the game is over._
